"I created an interesting file for one of my lazy friends. My friend said, 'Hey, I want to open this SQL file, but it takes forever for my computer's RAM to load it. Can you write some code that connects by itself, reads the databases with a name for me, then I can tell it which database I want, and it opens it, and then it data frames the tables and shows it to me?' I said, 'Sure, I'll make it for you!' And I was able to create this weird code, and I wanted to share it with you here. Maybe it could be useful for you. Good luck!"
